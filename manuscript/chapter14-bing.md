# Search {#chapter-bing}
Now that our Rango application is looking good and most of the core functionality has been implemented, we can move onto some of the more advanced functionality. In this chapter, we will connect Rango up to a search API so that users can also search for pages, rather than just browse categories. The main point of this chapter is to show you how you can connect and use other web services - and how to integrate them within your own application. 

The search API that we will be using will be Microsoft's Bing Search API, but you could as easily  use the APIs provided by [Webhose](https://webhose.io/) or [Yandex](https://yandex.com/support/search/robots/search-api.html), instead. 

To use the Bing Search API we will need to write a [wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern), which enables us to send a query and obtain the results from their API - and bring them back in a more convienent format. But, before we can do so, we first need to set up an Azure account to use Bing's Search API.

## The Bing Search API
The [Bing Search API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference) provides you with the ability to embed search results from the Bing search engine within your own applications. Through a straightforward interface, you can request results from Bing's servers to be returned in either XML or JSON. The data returned can then be interpreted by a XML or JSON parser, with the results then rendered as part of a template within your application.

Although the Bing API can handle requests for different kinds of content, we'll be focusing on web search only for this tutorial - as well as handling JSON responses. To use the Bing Search API, you will need to sign up for an *API key*. The key currently provides subscribers with access to 3000 queries per month, which should be more than enough for our purposes.

I> ### Application Programming Interface (API)
I> An [Application Programming Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) specifies how software components should interact with one another. In the context of web applications, an API is considered as a set of HTTP requests along with a definition of the structures of response messages that each request can return. Any meaningful service that can be offered over the Internet can have its own API - we aren't limited to web search. For more information on web APIs, [Luis Rei provides an excellent tutorial on APIs](http://blog.luisrei.com/articles/rest.html).


### Registering for a Bing API Key
To obtain a Bing API key, you must first register for a Microsoft Azure account. The account provides you with access to a wide range of Microsoft services. If you already have a Microsoft account, you dont need to register you can log in. Otherwise, you can go online and create a free account with Microsoft at [`https://account.windowsazure.com`](https://account.windowsazure.com).

When your account has been created, log in and go to the portal.

On the left hand side of the page you should see a list, and at the top of the list it should say  `+ Create a resource`. Click on create a resource, and then select `AI + Machine Learning`. Scroll through the options, and select the `Bing Search v7` option, follow the instructions and register for the service. Make sure you select the `F0 Free` pricing tier, which enables you to make 3000 calls per month - which is more than enough for our purposes.

Once you've signed up, and added the Bing Search v7 API, select the service, and click on the `Keys` tab. Here you will be able to access two keys - which you should not share with anyone.

Assuming this all works take a copy of your API key. We will need this when we make requests as part of the authentication process. 

## Adding Search Functionality
Below we have provided the code that we can use to issue queries to the Bing search service. Create a file called `rango/bing_search.py` and import the following code. You will note that we need to import a package called `requests` so that we can make web requests. However, to use the `requests` package you will need to run, `pip install requests` to install it with your virtual environment, first.

{lang="python",linenos=on}
	import json
	import requests

	# Add your Microsoft Account Key to a file called bing.key
	def read_bing_key():
		"""
		reads the BING API key from a file called 'bing.key'
		returns: a string which is either None, i.e. no key found, or with a key
		remember to put bing.key in your .gitignore file to avoid committing it to the repo.
	
		See Python Anti-Patterns - it is an awesome resource to improve your python code
		Here we using "with" when opening documents
		http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/maintainability/not_using_with_to_open_files.html
		"""
	
		bing_api_key = None
		try:
			with open('bing.key','r') as f:
				bing_api_key = f.readline().strip()
			
		except:
			raise IOError('bing.key file not found')
		
		if not bing_api_key:
			raise KeyError('Bing key not found')	
	
		return bing_api_key

	def run_query(search_terms):
		"""
		See the Microsoft's documentation on other parameters that you can set.
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference
		"""
		bing_key = read_bing_key()
		search_url = 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/search'
		headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" : bing_key}
		params  = {"q": search_terms, "textDecorations":True, "textFormat":"HTML"}
		response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)
		response.raise_for_status()
		search_results = response.json()
		results = []
		for result in search_results["webPages"]["value"]:
			results.append({
				'title': result['name'],
				'link': result['url'],
				'summary': result['snippet']})
		return results

In the module(s) above, we have implemented two functions: one to retrieve your Bing API key from a local file, and another to issue a query to the Bing search engine. Below, we discuss how both of the functions work.

### `read_bing_key()` - Reading the Bing Key {#section-bing-adding-key}
The `read_bing_key()` function reads in your key from a file called `bing.key`, located in your Django project's root directory (i.e. `<workspace>/tango_with_django/`). We have created this function because if you are putting your code into a public repository on GitHub for example, you should take some precautions to avoid sharing your API Key publicly. 

From the Azure website, take a copy of your *Account key* and save it into `<workspace>/tango_with_django/bing.key`. The key should be the only contents of the file - nothing else should exist within it. This file should NOT be committed to your GitHub repository. To make sure that you do not accidentally commit it, update your repository's `.gitignore` file to exclude any files with a `.key` extension, by adding the line `*.key`. This way, your key file will only be stored locally and you will not end up with someone using your query quota (or worse).

T> Keep them secret, keep them safe!


### `run_query()` - Executing the Query
The `run_query()` function takes a query as a string, and returns the top ten results from Bing in a list that contains a dictionary of the result items (including the `title`, a `link`, and a `summary`). 

To summarise though, the logic of the `run_query()` function can be broadly split into six main tasks.

* First, the function prepares for connecting to Bing by preparing the URL that we'll be requesting.
* The function then prepares authentication, making use of your Bing API key. This is obtained by calling `read_bing_key()`, which in turn pulls your Account key from the `bing.key` file you created earlier.
* The response is then parsed into a Python dictionary object using the `json` Python package.
* We loop through each of the returned results, populating a `results` dictionary. For each result, we take the `title` of the page, the `link` or URL and a short `summary` of each returned result.
* The list of dictionaries is then returned by the function.

<!-->
Notice that results are passed from Bing's servers as JSON. This is because they by default return the results using JSON. 

Also, note that if an error occurs when attempting to connect to Bing's servers, the error is printed to the terminal via the `print` statement within the `except` block.
-->

I> ###Bing it on!
I> There are many different parameters that the Bing Search API can handle which we don't cover here. 
I> If you want to know more about the API check out the [Bing Search API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-web-api-v7-reference).

X> ### Exercises
X> Extend your `bing_search.py` module so that it can be run independently, i.e. running `python bing_search.py` from your terminal or Command Prompt. Specifically, you should implement functionality that:
X> 
X> - prompts the the user to enter a query, i.e. use `raw_input()`; and
X> - issues the query via `run_query()`, and prints the results.
X>
X> Update the `run_query()` method so that it handles network errors gracefully.


T> ### Hint
T> Add the following code, so that when you run `python bing_search.py` it calls the `main()` function:
T> 	
T> {lang="python",linenos=off}
T>		def main():
T>		    #insert your code here
T>		
T>		if __name__ == '__main__':
T>		    main()
T>
T> When you run the module explicitly via `python bing_search.py`, the `bing_search` module is treated as the `__main__` module, and thus triggers `main()`. However, when the module is imported by another module, then `__name__` will not equal `__main__`, and thus the `main()` function not be called. This way you can `import` it with your application without having to call `main()`.


## Putting Search into Rango
Now that we have successfully implemented the search functionality module, we need to integrate it into our Rango app. There are two main steps that we need to complete for this to work.

-  We must first create a `search.html` template that extends from our `base.html` template. The `search.html` template will include a HTML `<form>` to capture the user's query as well as template code to present any results.
- We then create a view to handle the rendering of the `search.html` template for us, as well as calling the `run_query()` function we defined above.

### Adding a Search Template
Let's first create a template called, `rango/search.html`. Add the following HTML markup, Django template code, and Bootstrap classes.

{lang="html",linenos=on}
	{% extends 'rango/base.html' %}
	{% load staticfiles %}
	
	{% block title %} Search {% endblock %}
	
	{% block body_block %}
	<div>
	    <h1>Search with Rango</h1>
	    <br/>
	    <form class="form-inline" id="user_form" 
	          method="post" action="{% url 'rango:search' %}">
	        {% csrf_token %}
	        <div class="form-group">
	            <input class="form-control" type="text" size="50" 
	                   name="query" value="" id="query" />
	        </div>
	        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" name="submit"
	                value="Search">Search</button>
	    </form>
	    
	    <div>
	        {% if result_list %}
	        <h3>Results</h3>
	        <!-- Display search results in an ordered list -->
	        <div class="list-group">
	        {% for result in result_list %}
	            <div class="list-group-item">
	                <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">
	                    <a href="{{ result.link }}">{{ result.title|safe|escape}}</a>
	                    </h4>
	                    <p class="list-group-item-text">{{ result.summary|safe|escape }}</p>
	            </div>
	        {% endfor %}
	        </div>
	        {% endif %}
	    </div>
	</div>	
	{% endblock %}

The template code above performs two key tasks.

- In all scenarios, the template presents a search box and a search buttons within a HTML `<form>` for users to enter and submit their search queries.
- If a `results_list` object is passed to the template's context when being rendered, the template then iterates through the object displaying the results contained within.
	
To style the HTML, we have made use of Bootstrap [jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/jumbotron/), [list groups](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/list-group/), and [forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/forms/).

To render the title and summary correctly, we have used the `safe` and `escape` tags to inform the template that the `result.title` and `result.summary` should be rendered as is (i.e. as HTML).

In the view code, in the next subsection, we will only pass through the results to the template, when the user issues a query. Initially, there will be no results to show.

### Adding the View
With our search template added, we can then add the view that prompts the rendering of our template. Add the following `search()` view to Rango's `views.py` module.

{lang="python",linenos=off}	
	def search(request):
	    result_list = []
	    
	    if request.method == 'POST':
	        query = request.POST['query'].strip()
	        if query:
	            # Run our Bing function to get the results list!
	            result_list = run_query(query)
	    
	    return render(request, 'rango/search.html', {'result_list': result_list})
	
By now, the code should be pretty self explanatory to you. The only major addition is the calling of the `run_query()` function we defined earlier in this chapter. To call it, we are required to also import the `bing_search.py` module, too. Ensure that before you run the script that you add the following `import` statement at the top of the `views.py` module.

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	from rango.bing_search import run_query, read_bing_key

You'll also need to ensure you do the following, too.

- Add a mapping between your `search()` view and the `/rango/search/` URL calling it `name='search'` by adding in `path('search/', views.search, name='search'),` to `rango/urls.py`.
- Also, update the `base.html` navigation bar to include a link to the search page. Remember to use the `url` template tag to reference the link.
- You will need a copy of the `bing.key` in your project's root directory (`<workspace>/tango_with_django_project`, alongside `manage.py`).

Once you have put in the URL mapping and added a link to the search page, you should now be able issue queries to the Bing Search API and have the results shown within the Rango app (as shown in the figure below).

X> ### Additional Exercise
X>
X> You may notice that when you issue a query, the query disappears when the results are shown. This is not very user friendly. Update the view and template so that the user's query is displayed within the search box.
X>
X> Within the view, you will need to put the `query` into the context dictionary. Within the template, you will need to show the query text in the search box.
