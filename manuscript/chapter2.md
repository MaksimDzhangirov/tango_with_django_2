# Getting Ready to Tango {#chapter-getting-ready}
Before we start coding, it's really important that we set your development environment up correctly so that you can *Tango with Django* easily. You'll need to make sure that you have all of the necessary components installed on your computer, and that they are configured correctly. This chapter outlines the six key components you'll need to be aware of, setup and use. These are:

* the [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) (on macOS or UNIX/Linux systems), or the [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (on Windows);
* *Python 3*, including how to code and run Python scripts;
* the Python Package Manager *pip*;
* *Virtual Environments*;
* your *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*, if you choose to use one; and
* a *Version Control System (VCS)* called *Git*.

If you already have Python 3 and Django 2 installed on your computer and are familar with the technologies listed above, you can skip straight ahead to the [Django Basics chapter](#chapter-django-basics). If you are not familiar with some or all of the technologies listed, we provide an overview of each below. These go hand in hand with later [supplementary chapter](#chapter-system-setup) that provide a series of pointers on how to set the different components up, if you need help doing so.

I> ### You Development Environment is Important!
I> Setting up your development environment can be a tedious and frustrating process. It's not something that you would do everyday. The pointers we provide in this chapter (and the [additional supplementary chapter](#chapter-system-setup)) should help you in getting everything to a working state. The effort you expend now in making sure everything works will ensure that development can proceed unhindered.
I>
I> From experience, we can also say with confidence that as you set your environment up it's a good idea to note down the steps that you took. You will probably need that workflow again one day -- maybe you will purchase a new computer, or be asked to help a friend set their environment up, too. *Don't think short-term, think long-term!*

## Python 3 {#chapter-getting-ready-python3}
To work with Tango with Django, we require you to have installed on your computer a copy of the *Python 3* programming language. A Python version of 3.4 or greater should work fine with Django 2.1 -- although the official Django website recommends that you have the most recent version of Python installed. As such, we recommend you install *Python 3.7*. At the time of writing, the most recent release is *Python 3.7.2.* If you're not sure how to install Python and would like some assistance, have a look at [our quick guide on how to install Python](#section-system-setup-python).

W> ### Running macOS, Linux or UNIX?
W>
W> On installations of macOS, Linux or UNIX, you will find that Python is already installed on your computer -- albeit a much older version, typically 2.x. This version is required by your operating system to perform essential tasks such as downloading and installing updates. While you can use this version, it most likely won't be compatiable with Django 2, and you'll need to install a newer version of Python to run *side-by-side* with the old installation. *Do not uninstall Python 2.x* if it is already present on your system; you may break your operating system!

I> ## Python Skills Rusty?
I>
I> If you haven't used Python before -- or you simply want to brush up on you skills -- then we highly recommend that you check out and work through one or more of the following guides:
I>
I> * [**The Official Python Tutorial**](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/);
I> * [**Think Python: How to Think like a Computer Scientist**](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) by Allen B. Downey; or
I> * [**Learn Python in 10 Minutes**](http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/) by Stavros;
I> * [**Learn to Program**](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1) by Jennifer Campbell and Paul Gries.
I>
I> These guides will help you familiarise yourself with the basics of Python so you can start developing with Django. Note you don't need to be an expert in Python to work with Django -- Python is straightforward to use, and you can pick it up as you go, especially if you already know another programming language.

## Virtual Environments {#chapter-getting-ready-venv}
With a working installation of Python 3 (and the basic programming skills to go with it), we can now setup our environment for the Django project (called Rango) we'll be creating in this tutorial. One super useful tool we *strongly* encourage you to use is a virtual environment. Although not strictly necessary, it provides a useful separation between your computer's Python installation and the environment you'll be using to develop Rango with.

A virtual environment allows for multiple installations of Python packages to exist in harmony, within unique *Python environments*. Why is this useful? Say you have a project, `projectA` that you want to run in Django 1.11, and a further project, `projectB` written for Django 2.1. This presents a problem as you would normally only be able to install one version of the required software at a time. By creating virtual environments for each project, you can then install the respective versions of Django (and any other required Python software) within each unique environment. This ensures that the software installed in one environment does not tamper with the software installed on another.

You'll want to create a virtual environment using Python 3 for your Rango development environment. Call the environment `rangoenv`. If you are unsure as to how to do this, go to the supplementary chapter detailing [how to set up virtual environments before continuing.](#section-system-setup-virtualenv). If you do choose to use a virtual environment, remember to activate the virtual environment by issuing the following command.

{lang="bash",linenos=off}
	$ workon rangoenv

From then on, all of your prompts with the Terminal or Command Prompt will precede with the name of your virtual environment to remind you that it is switched on. Check out the following example to know what we are discussing.

{lang="bash",linenos=off}
	$ workon rangoenv
	(rangoenv) $ pip install django==2.1.5
	...
	(rangoenv) $ deactivate
	$ 

The penultimate line of the example above demonstrates how to switch your virtual environment off after you have finished with it -- note the lack of `(rangoenv)` before the prompt. Again, [refer to the later chapter in this tutorial](#section-system-setup-virtualenv) for more information on how to setup and use virtual environments.

## The Python Package Manager
Going hand in hand with virtual environments, we'll also be making use of the Python package manager, *pip*, to install a number of different Python software packages -- including Django -- to our development environment. Specifically, we'll need to install two packages: Django 2.1.5 and *Pillow*. Pillow is a Python package providing support for handling image files (e.g. `.jpg` and `.png` files), something we'll be doing later in this tutorial.

A package manager, whether for Python, your [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) or [some other environment](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install), is a software tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing *packages* -- that is, a package of software which you can use on your computer. This is opposed to downloading, installing and maintaining software manually. Maintaining Python packages is pretty painful. Most packages often have *dependencies* -- additional packages that are required for your package to work! This can get very complex very quickly. A package manager handles all of this for you, along with issues such as conflicts regarding different versions of a package. Luckily, *pip* handles all this for you -- so you can sit back and relax.

Try and run the command `$ pip3` for the Python 3 version of the package manager. If that doesn't work, you have a setup issue -- refer to our [pip setup guide](#section-system-setup-pip) for help.

With your virtual environment switched on, execute the following two commands to install Django and Pillow.

{lang="bash",linenos=off}
	$ pip install django==2.1.5
	$ pip install pillow==5.0.0

This will be enough to get you started. As you work through the tutorial, there will be a couple more packages that we will require. These will be installed as we require them. For now, you're good to go.

I> ### Problems Installing `pillow`?
I>
I> When installing Pillow, you may receive an error stating that the installation failed due to a lack of JPEG support.
I> This error is shown as the following:
I> 
I> {lang="text",linenos=off}
I> 	ValueError: jpeg is required unless explicitly disabled using
I> 	            --disable-jpeg, aborting
I>
I> If you receive this error, try installing Pillow *without* JPEG support enabled, with the following command.
I>
I> {lang="text",linenos=off}
I> 	pip install pillow --global-option="build_ext"
I> 	                   --global-option="--disable-jpeg"
I>
I> While you obviously will have a lack of support for handling JPEG images, Pillow should then install without problem. Getting Pillow installed is enough for you to get started with this tutorial. For further information, check out the [Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

T> ### Working within in a Virtual Environment
T>
T> Substitute `pip3` with `pip` when working within your virtual environment. The command `pip` is aliased to the correct one for your virtual environment.

## Integrated Development Environment
While not absolutely necessary, a good Python-based IDE can be very helpful to you during the development process. Several exist, with perhaps [*PyCharm*](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by JetBrains and *PyDev* (a plugin of the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) standing out as popular choices. The [Python Wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) provides an up-to-date list of Python IDEs.

Research which one is right for you, and be aware that some may require you to purchase a licence. Ideally, you'll want to select an IDE that supports integration with Django. Of course, if you prefer not to use an IDE, using a simple text editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) will do just fine. Many modern text editors actually support Python syntax highlighting, which makes things much easier!

We use PyCharm as it supports virtual environments and Django integration -- though you will have to configure the IDE accordingly. We don't cover that here - although JetBrains do provide a [guide on setting PyCharm up](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/creating-and-running-your-first-django-project.html).

## Version Control System
We should also point out that when you develop code, you should always house your code within a version-controlled repository such as [SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/) or [Git](http://git-scm.com/). We won't be explaining this right now, so that we can get stuck into developing an application in Django. We have however written a [chapter providing a crash course on Git](#chapter-git) for your reference that you can refer to later on. **We highly recommend that you set up a Git repository for your own projects.**

X> ### Exercises

D> ### What is a Directory?
D>
D> In the text above, we refer to creating a *directory*. But what exactly is a *directory*? If you have used a Windows computer up until now, you'll know a directory as a *folder*. The concept of a folder is analogous to a directory -- it is a cataloguing structure that contains references to other files and directories.

Once you've worked through all of these exercises, you'll be a competent Python programmer -- and will have a computer that is set up and ready to *Tango with Django!*
